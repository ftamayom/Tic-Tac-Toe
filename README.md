# Tic-Tac-Toe game

A Tic-Tac-Toe game with React.js.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

* ### Implement animations:
  To improve the UX and make interactions more fluid and fun. Some effects, like bouncing on click or getting up when hovering with the cursor.
* ### Implement multiplayer with Socket.io:
  I think playing it online will make it more fun, with Socket.io I can update it in real time. Due to the simplicity of the project, you will not require a good internet connection for a good experience.
* ### Add login and users:
  To turn it into a finished project, with a simple login you can deploy into production, so you can save your own personal record and play with your friends.
